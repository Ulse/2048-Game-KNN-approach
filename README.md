# 2048-Game
Teaching the computer to play the game 2048 using k-nearest neighbors algorithm

The goal of this program is to “teach” the computer to play the game 2048.
2048 is a game based on a 4x4 grid in which tiles may lie. The user must shift 
the tiles up, down, left, or right in an attempt to merge like adjacent tiles. 
After every move, a new tile spawns on the board. The goal is to prevent the board from becoming full.
